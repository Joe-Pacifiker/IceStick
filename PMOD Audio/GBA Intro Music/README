This project will store all of the bits for the GBA intro music in the 16 blocks of 4Kb RAM available on the IceSugar-Nano FPGA.

In order to fill the memory it will need to processed from a pool of data parsed from python.
The provided python script collects the raw audio data from the mp3 file.

Not all of the audio data will be able to be processed at once since there isn't enough memory on the FPGA.
My plan is to use the SDIO interface to store data on a microSD card and keep note of various address locations.
I should be able to do this in a robust format going forward such that all music data can be sent to the same microSD card.

My current microSD card can hold 32GB of data.
