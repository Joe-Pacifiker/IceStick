This is an older version of the PCM decode project for the GBA intro wav audio file

In this version I was trying to do some complicated quantizing of the PCM values
 however I discovered that was not the correct way to do it.

I should just take each sample and send it through to a DAC, it would be much easier
 that way instead of trying to convert PCM to PWM.
