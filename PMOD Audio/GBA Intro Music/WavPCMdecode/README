This Python scripting project extracts the PCM data from the GBA Intro wav file.

The next step after the extraction of the PCM data is to initialize IceStick BRAM with this data.

I plan to use 8 bit addressable halfword RAM

After initialization I will send the RAM data to the speaker at 768khz clock frequency
 since the wav file header is using 48000 samples/second with each sample being 16 bit PCM data.

When I was working with the MP3 file data I misunderstood the fact that it was NOT raw audio data but encrypted.
I expect to see different results using this raw PCM data from the wav file.

According to my calculations I may need to go through ~20 different sessions of audio playing from the IceStick memory
 since it only has 65,536 bits of BRAM space instead of its documented 128Kb of BRAM.
